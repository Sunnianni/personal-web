What if you are newcomer? What if you don't know the city? What if you don't know German and learned only "danke" in four months? What if you missed a deadline and didn't sign up for a Typography Seminar? What if you sat at the laptop for a long time and your eyes are no longer blue, but just red? Keep moving! Your path is full of answers!
